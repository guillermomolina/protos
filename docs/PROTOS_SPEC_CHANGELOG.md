# Protos Language Specification Changelog

All notable changes to the Protos language specification will be documented in this file.

Specification version follows the document revision number: 0.1.X where X is the revision.

## [0.1.44] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Complete Core v0.1 reserved-word set definition: `this`, `context`, `args`, `super`, `true`, `false`, `null`.
- Reserved-word recognition rules: case-sensitive matching after lexical identifier recognition.
- Clarification that prelude names (`Object`, `Future`, `Number`, `String`, `Map`, `IdentityMap`, etc.) are not reserved words.
- Clarification that Core v0.1 does not reserve control-flow or declaration keywords such as `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `class`, `function`, `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `async`, or `await`.

## [0.1.43] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Core v0.1 identifier syntax definition: Unicode-aware, case-sensitive, begin with `_` or `XID_Start`, continue with `XID_Continue`.
- Core v0.1 identifier normalization requirement: all identifiers must be in Unicode NFC form, implementations must reject non-NFC identifiers.
- Clarification that identifier normalization applies to spelling only, not to `String` values.
- Reserved word recognition rules after lexical identifier recognition.

## [0.1.42] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Core v0.1 numeric literal syntax definition: decimal and radix literals (`0x`, `0b`, `0o`), digit separators, decimal point and exponent handling.
- Core v0.1 prefix operator semantics: prefix `-` lowers to `negated()`, prefix `!` lowers to `not()`, prefix `+` is unsupported, operators apply to arbitrary expressions.

### Changed
- Clarified numeric literal constraints: no leading sign as part of literal, no type suffixes, no `NaN`/`Infinity` literal syntax, unsupported hex/binary/octal Float forms.
- Clarified prefix operator lowering as protocol-based message dispatch rather than privileged intrinsics.

## [0.1.41] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Core v0.1 string literal syntax: single-quoted, double-quoted, and triple-double-quoted forms with unified escape rules.
- Core v0.1 escape sequences: `\\`, `\'`, `\"`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\b`, `\f`, and `\u{HEX}`.
- Core v0.1 multiline string indentation normalization rule.
- Core v0.1 comment syntax: `//` line comments, `/* ... */` block comments, no nesting, no `#` syntax, no documentation-comment feature.

### Changed
- Specified constraint: no octal escapes, no `\xNN` escapes, no string interpolation.
- Clarified that Triple-single-quoted strings are not supported.
