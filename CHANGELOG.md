# Changelog

All notable changes to the Protos implementation project will be documented in this file.

For specification changes, see [spec/PROTOS_SPEC_CHANGELOG.md](spec/PROTOS_SPEC_CHANGELOG.md).

## [0.2.11-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Added the first executable distributable Core source,
  `protos/lib/core/context.protos`.
- The Core source constructs the standard `Context` prototype as an ordinary
  Protos object with `Object` as its delegation parent.
- Added coverage that loads and executes that Core source through the ordinary
  source-file/compiler pipeline and observes the resulting `Context` binding.

### Changed

- Project implementation version changed from `0.2.10-SNAPSHOT` to `0.2.11-SNAPSHOT`.

### Notes

- The existing Java-side `Context` in `ProtosCorePrelude` remains temporary
  bootstrap scaffolding for now. This increment establishes the source-side
  replacement before changing activation construction to consume it.
- No special Core parser, AST, object constructor, or Java-side standard
  prototype was added.
- No normative specification change is introduced.


## [0.2.10-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Added `ProtosSourceFileLoader` to read UTF-8 Protos source from a host `Path`
  and compile it through the existing ordinary source compiler pipeline.
- Added focused coverage for successful UTF-8 loading and host file-loading
  failure propagation.

### Changed

- Project implementation version changed from `0.2.9-SNAPSHOT` to
  `0.2.10-SNAPSHOT`.

### Notes

- This is host-side implementation plumbing, not the Protos language I/O model.
  It does not expose `Path`, Java NIO, or file-loading behavior to Protos code.
- The loader deliberately does not define module identity, import caching,
  bootstrap order, or Core object identities. Those higher-level semantics stay
  outside this increment.
- This entry point is intended for the upcoming `protos/lib/core/` bootstrap
  loader and ordinary module-loading machinery.
- No normative specification change is introduced.


## [0.2.9-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Added `ProtosSourceCompiler`, a single source-to-execution entry point that
  composes the existing parser, canonicalizer, Truffle lowerer, and call-target
  construction pipeline.
- Added focused coverage proving compiled source preserves ordinary sequence,
  literal, object-construction, and parser-failure behavior.

### Changed

- Project implementation version changed from `0.2.8-SNAPSHOT` to
  `0.2.9-SNAPSHOT`.

### Notes

- This is implementation plumbing only. It introduces no new syntax, lookup,
  invocation, object, or bootstrap semantics.
- The new entry point is intended to be reused by the upcoming
  `protos/lib/core/` loader so Core source and user source travel through the
  same ordinary compiler pipeline.
- No normative specification change is introduced.


## [0.2.8-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Fixed `ProtosArgumentVectorNodeTest` to use the actual `SourceSpan` constructor
  instead of a nonexistent `SourceSpan.unknown()` helper.
- Project implementation version changed from `0.2.7-SNAPSHOT` to
  `0.2.8-SNAPSHOT`.

### Notes

- This is a test-compilation correction only; caller argument-vector semantics
  and implementation behavior are unchanged.
- No normative specification change is introduced.


## [0.2.7-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Added the caller-supplied positional-vector evaluation stage for future
  polymorphic invocation.
- Ordinary argument items are evaluated exactly once from left to right.
- Spread items require standard Array indexed state and append a shallow
  ascending-index snapshot at their exact evaluation position.
- Invalid spread sources signal Core `Error` immediately and prevent later
  argument evaluation.

### Changed

- Project implementation version changed from `0.2.6-SNAPSHOT` to `0.2.7-SNAPSHOT`.

### Notes

- This increment deliberately stops before Closure activation and parameter
  binding. It therefore does not need to manufacture the standard frozen
  `args` Array before the Core `Array` prototype is available from
  `protos/lib/core/`.
- No standard Array prototype or protocol behavior is hardcoded in Java.
- No normative specification change is introduced.


## [0.2.6-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Removed temporary Java-side `Number`, `Integer`, and `Float` prototype objects
  from `ProtosCorePrelude`.
- Removed the Java-side numeric-family prototype resolver and the tests that
  treated those temporary objects as the implementation's standard numeric
  prelude.
- Kept only the explicitly documented temporary `Context` bootstrap scaffold.
- Project implementation version changed from `0.2.5-SNAPSHOT` to
  `0.2.6-SNAPSHOT`.

### Notes

- Numeric value representations and already-implemented numeric literal/identity
  semantics are unchanged.
- This corrects an implementation-architecture regression: standard numeric
  prototype objects belong to the future `protos/lib/core/` bootstrap path
  rather than a growing hardcoded Java standard library.
- No normative specification change is introduced.


## [0.2.5-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Added an internal standard-Array object representation with receiver-owned
  dense indexed state distinct from ordinary object slots.
- Array indexed reads and updates use mathematical `BigInteger` indices,
  preserve exact element references, reject negative/out-of-range indices, and
  never grow or create holes.
- Closed Arrays may replace existing indexed elements while frozen Arrays reject
  replacement before index validation.
- Added detached shallow indexed snapshots for future call-spread and iteration
  semantics.

### Changed

- `ProtosObjectValue` is now extensible internally so specialized object
  representations can retain the ordinary object/delegation/slot model without
  adding parallel language object categories.
- Project implementation version changed from `0.2.4-SNAPSHOT` to
  `0.2.5-SNAPSHOT`.

### Notes

- This increment adds representation only. It does not hardcode or expose the
  standard `Array` prelude object or its protocol methods in Java.
- The explicit parent supplied to each Array instance preserves the normative
  Array-factory rule and will allow `protos/lib/core/` to own the standard
  prototype object when Core bootstrap is available.
- No normative specification change is introduced.


## [0.2.4-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Added execution of canonical composition items inside object bodies.
- Composition evaluates its source first, copies effective local bindings into
  the object under construction, and makes successful contributions immediately
  visible to later body items.
- Direct local declarations reserve their names structurally across the complete
  receiving object body, excluding those names from every composition item.
- Composition conflicts and invalid non-ordinary composition sources now signal
  Core `Error` objects instead of leaking host exceptions.

### Changed

- Canonical object-body lowering now supplies the object's structural reservation
  set to each composition item while preserving strict left-to-right body
  execution.
- Project implementation version changed from `0.2.3-SNAPSHOT` to
  `0.2.4-SNAPSHOT`.

### Notes

- Composition reuses the existing atomic runtime contribution helper, so a
  conflicting item installs none of its effective bindings.
- `without` and `alias` remain blocked by B002 and are not exposed by this
  increment.
- No normative specification change is introduced.


## [0.2.3-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Added Truffle execution for canonical object expressions without composition.
- Bare object expressions now create fresh open ordinary objects delegating to
  the unique `Object` root.
- Explicit parent expressions are evaluated before object-body execution and
  their exact result becomes the constructed object's immutable delegation
  parent.
- Object bodies execute through construction activations, so local slot creation
  targets the new object while Closures skip the construction object as a lexical
  capture scope.

### Changed

- Canonical-to-Truffle lowering now accepts `CanonicalObject` when all body
  expressions are otherwise supported by the current execution slice.
- Project implementation version changed from `0.2.2-SNAPSHOT` to
  `0.2.3-SNAPSHOT`.

### Notes

- Canonical composition execution remains a separate following increment.
- No normative specification change is introduced; this implements the current
  object-model and execution-context contracts.


## [0.2.2-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Added explicit object-construction activations whose current context and
  receiver are the object under construction while Closure capture skips that
  construction object.
- Added transitive construction-scope skipping so Closures created inside nested
  object bodies capture only genuine enclosing lexical contexts.

### Changed

- Closure materialization now obtains its lexical capture chain from activation
  semantics instead of unconditionally capturing the activation's current
  context.
- Project implementation version changed from `0.2.1-SNAPSHOT` to
  `0.2.2-SNAPSHOT`.

### Notes

- This is implementation architecture for already-specified object-construction
  and lexical-capture semantics; no normative specification change is introduced.
- The new construction-activation boundary is intended to support subsequent
  canonical object execution and Core source bootstrap.


## [0.2.1-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Added executable numeric literal materialization and semantic identity execution.
- Added the runtime ordinary-object foundation with immutable delegation parents,
  local/delegated lookup, slot mutation, structural open/closed/frozen state,
  local-slot removal and snapshots, composition views, and atomic composition
  contributions.
- Added activation-context lookup ordering, Core error signaling, `this` and
  `context` execution, bare/member slot mutation, member lookup-home preservation,
  Closure materialization, and extracted-method binding foundations.
- Added empty-Sequence execution returning canonical `null`.
- Added canonical object composition-reservation discovery for direct local
  declarations.
- Added the initial standard `Context` bootstrap scaffold and fresh execution
  contexts delegating through `Context` to `Object`.
- Added the non-normative Core bootstrap architecture and reserved
  `protos/lib/core/` for standard objects and behavior implemented in Protos.

### Changed

- Project implementation version changed from `0.2.0-SNAPSHOT` to
  `0.2.1-SNAPSHOT`.
- Established an explicit repository rule requiring every committed executable
  implementation or distributable Core-library change to bump the Maven
  implementation patch version and add its corresponding root changelog entry.
- Limited Java-side standard-object construction to irreducible or explicitly
  temporary bootstrap scaffolding; ordinary Core behavior should move to
  `protos/lib/core/` as soon as it can be loaded faithfully.

### Notes

- This entry catches up implementation release metadata that was not maintained
  during the preceding incremental runtime/execution work.
- Protos Core language version remains 0.1.
- No normative language semantics are changed by the bootstrap architecture
  decision; observable Core behavior remains defined exclusively by `spec/`.
- The current Java-side `Context` bootstrap is temporary scaffolding until the
  Core source loader can construct it faithfully.

## [0.2.0-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Added canonical String literal execution as ordinary immutable Protos String values.

- Added initial Canonical-to-Truffle lowering for canonical `true`, `false`, and `null` singleton literals and non-empty sequences.

- Added a Truffle CallTarget entry point for executing Protos expression trees through the root-node boundary.
- Added the initial Truffle root execution boundary, delegating directly to the executable expression tree without introducing language-value semantics.

- Added the first executable Truffle node: non-empty expression sequences execute strictly left-to-right and return the final child result.
- Added the initial Truffle execution-node boundary with source-span preservation and the Truffle API dependency.
- Added canonical call-spread lowering with a contextual `CanonicalSpread(expression)` marker for ordinary, member, and super invocation arguments.
- Added dedicated canonical indexed-assignment lowering that preserves receiver/index/value evaluation structure and the distinct `atPut` assignment-result semantics.
- Added dedicated canonical lowering for non-spread `super.message(arguments...)` operations, preserving super lookup semantics separately from ordinary message sends.
- Added dedicated canonical intrinsic nodes for the reserved execution-context expressions `this`, `context`, and `args`, keeping them distinct from ordinary lexical lookup.
- Added canonical lowering for non-spread calls, preserving the semantic distinction between ordinary `Call(receiver, arguments)` and member message `Send(receiver, message, arguments)` forms.
- Added canonical object lowering with optional explicit parent, canonical object-body sequencing, and `Compose(object)` nodes for contextual composition items.
- Added canonical `Return(value)` lowering for the `^ expression` non-local return form.
- Added canonical `Create`/`Assign` lowering for bare and explicit-member slot writes while leaving indexed assignment for its distinct `atPut` semantics.
- Added canonical lowering for indexed reads as ordinary one-argument `at` message sends.
- Added canonical lowering for lazy `&&` and `||` as `and`/`or` message sends whose right-hand side is wrapped in a parameterless canonical Closure.
- Added canonical Closure and parameter lowering, including mandatory normalization of expression-bodied Closures to a one-expression canonical Sequence.
- Added canonical lowering for semantic equality/inequality and non-overridable identity/non-identity, with a dedicated canonical identity node.
- Added canonical lowering for the standard comparison operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` as ordinary one-argument message sends.
- Added canonical lowering for the standard arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` as ordinary one-argument message sends.
- Added canonical lowering for custom symbolic binary operators as ordinary one-argument message sends while leaving standard binary operators for dedicated semantic lowering.
- Added canonical lowering for Core prefix `-` and `!` as ordinary zero-argument `negated` and `not` sends.
- Added the canonical semantic AST foundation and the first Surface AST canonicalization slice for literals, name lookup, grouping, member reads, and sequences.
- Established `.protos` as the project source-file extension and added initial non-normative tutorial, task-oriented example, and portable benchmark corpora.
- Added benchmark workloads for recursion, slots, closure and method calls, object creation, delegation depth, and monomorphic/polymorphic dispatch.
- Added parser support for same-line parameterless trailing closures as the final argument of ordinary call suffixes.
- Added closure surface AST integration and deterministic parsing for closure parameters, defaults, rest parameters, and braced or expression bodies.
- Added parser support for object expressions, parent expressions, and contextual object composition items.
- Added parser support for structural super message sends without making `super` a first-class expression.
- Added parsing for slot creation and assignment with grammar-defined target restrictions.
- Added deterministic parsing for the grammar-defined non-local return expression.
- Added parser support for the separate custom binary-operator precedence domain and its required standard/custom mixing errors.
- Added deterministic parsing for the standard unary and binary operator precedence ladder.
- Added parser support for same-line semicolon expression separators with the grammar-defined error cases.
- Extended the parser foundation with parenthesized expressions, member access, calls, indexing, argument spread, and leading-dot continuation.
- Added the first deterministic parser foundation with source-aware errors and a portable surface AST.
- Added source-aware lexer token occurrences with portable half-open source spans as parser infrastructure.
- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for raw Unicode scalar handling across every Core String form, including rejection of unpaired surrogates.
- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for numeric termination at structural delimiters, logical newlines, and standard and custom operators.
- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for uppercase radix-prefix commitment and case-insensitive exponent completion errors.
- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for malformed numeric/identifier adjacency across ASCII, reserved-word, underscore, and Unicode identifier continuations.

- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for triple-double String CR/CRLF delimiter-newline handling and shared escape semantics.
- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for Unicode escape digit-count boundaries, hexadecimal case handling, and the closed String escape set.
- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for exact, case-sensitive reserved-word recognition and the closed Core v0.1 reserved-word set.
- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for triple-double String structural indentation, including absent and empty prefixes, blank-line exemption, and exact SPACE/TAB matching.
- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for the symbolic-operator alphabet, maximal-munch classification, and comment/operator lexical precedence.
- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for numeric separator placement, unsupported suffixes and radix floats, special-value identifiers, and valid token boundaries.
- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for line-comment termination, non-nesting block comments, first-delimiter closure, and comment delimiters inside Strings.
- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for String normalization independence, raw Unicode scalar content, quote-run boundaries, and the absence of triple-single String syntax.
- Expanded lexer conformance coverage for Core v0.1 String quote-run boundaries, unterminated String forms, and the closed whitespace rules.
- Added bundled Unicode 17.0.0 character-property and normalization data used by the lexer independently of the host JDK Unicode version.

- Corrected malformed parser imports introduced by slot-creation and assignment support.
- Restored the canonical NEWLINE token value after adding source-aware token occurrences.
- Fixed source-aware newline token occurrence emission so canonical NEWLINE lexemes remain valid Java Strings.
- Updated GitHub Actions CI to current supported `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-java` major versions.
- Relicensed Protos from the Server Side Public License (SSPL) v1 to the OSI-approved Adaptive Public License 1.0 (APL-1.0). The complete license, including the completed Exhibit A, is in [LICENSE.TXT](LICENSE.TXT).
- Project implementation version changed from `0.1.6-SNAPSHOT` to `0.2.0-SNAPSHOT`.

### Notes

- Protos Core language version remains 0.1.
- No language semantics changed.

### Fixed

- Fixed parser newline continuation while a member suffix or structural `super` message send is necessarily incomplete.
- Fixed parser newline continuation after `...` in spread arguments and rest parameters, matching the grammar's necessarily-incomplete construct rule.
## [0.1.6-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Expanded lexer support to cover the lexical rules defined by the current Core v0.1 specification.
- Added lexer support for comments, Unicode-aware identifiers, reserved words, numeric literal forms, multiline strings, ellipsis, and custom symbolic operators.

- Added regression coverage for supplementary Unicode escape sequences.

### Changed

- Updated lexer tests to match the current specification for reserved words, period tokenization, and numeric literals adjacent to periods.
- Unicode escape decoding now preserves supplementary Unicode code points instead of truncating them to Java `char` values.

### Notes

- The lexer implementation is still under specification-compliance review.
- Unicode identifier handling requires further review for exact `XID_Start` and `XID_Continue` compliance.
- Specification changes are documented separately in [spec/PROTOS_SPEC_CHANGELOG.md](spec/PROTOS_SPEC_CHANGELOG.md).
