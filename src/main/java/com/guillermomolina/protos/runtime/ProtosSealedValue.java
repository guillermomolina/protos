/**
 * Internal representation of an ordinary Protos object minted by a trusted sealing family
 * (LIB020-A).
 *
 * <p>It is not a new Protos value category: slots, delegation, mutation state, identity and every
 * other observable behavior are those of an ordinary frozen object. The only differences are the
 * family token, which lets the minting family recognize its own values without invoking any
 * behavior of a candidate, and a family-private state that is neither a slot nor otherwise
 * reachable from guest code. Guest code cannot mint these values: an ordinary object with the same
 * slots, parent or shape is never a member of the family.
 *
 * <p>Sealed values are not semantically portable: isolation transfer and isolated-parallel
 * transfer reject them instead of copying them into ordinary objects that would silently lose
 * their family.
