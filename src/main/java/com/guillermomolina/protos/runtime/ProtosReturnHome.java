/**
 * The Smalltalk-style return home an owning invocation establishes.
 *
 * <p>PERF025: a home that is statically proven unobservable (no non-local
 * return can ever target it; see {@code CanonicalReturnHomeAnalysis}) is
 * represented by the shared {@link #unobservable()} marker instead of a
 * fresh instance. The marker still carries home provenance (a Closure created
 * under it shares its owner's home rather than owning one), but it has no
 * lifecycle: owners never complete it, and a non-local return can never
 * target it. It is never a guest value, so its identity is not observable.
