/**
 * Parallel canonical-to-Bytecode lowering seam for the PERF006-B migration.
 *
 * <p>PERF006-B2D5C completes B2 invocation composition by supporting
 * caller-supplied spread in call/send default expressions as well as Closure
 * bodies. Body and default paths share the same backend-private supplied-vector
 * representation and the same immediate shallow Array snapshot rule at each
 * spread item's exact left-to-right position. Non-spread body/default fast paths
 * remain unchanged.
 * PERF006-B6A1 extends the same C-prime lowering with read-only member,
 * identity and execution-intrinsic expressions. PERF006-B6A2 adds canonical
 * slot creation/assignment and indexed assignment while preserving the AST
 * validation/evaluation order and composing ordinary atPut dispatch through
 * the same continuation backend. PERF006-B6A3A adds canonical super sends,
 * preserving physical method-home lookup, dynamic receiver identity, spread
 * argument semantics and C-prime suspension composition. PERF006-B6A3B adds
 * Closure literal materialization with exact lexical/receiver/method-home/
 * return-home/prelude capture and a pre-lowered Bytecode execution-plan
 * template per canonical Closure position. PERF006-B6A3C adds Object
 * literals and contextual composition using a pre-lowered child Bytecode
 * root per Object position plus a non-Closure construction carrier, so
 * construction activation/lexical-capture semantics and suspension are
 * preserved without manufacturing ReturnHome ownership.</p>
 *
 * <p>PLAT042 Candidate B′: every top-level, module and Closure activation root
 * produced here is a real tagged {@link ProtosBytecodeRootNode}. Automatic
 * physical root/body tags expose its execution, while the semantic activation
 * marker distinguishes it from auxiliary roots of the same interpreter, and
 * lexically nested Closure roots share that interpreter's {@code
 * BytecodeRootNodes} group. Structured prepared invocations are not lowered
 * here; they enter the auxiliary {@link ProtosStructuredDispatchLowerer} root
 * once per invocation.</p>
