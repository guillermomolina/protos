/**
 * PLAT054-3E4: Context and Process custody of the default Network of one embedded Process
 * ({@code PROCESS_IO.md}, Embedding network grant and thread policy).
 *
 * <p>This object is the opaque authority target of the bootstrap-local {@code network}
 * capability; it exists only when the Context effectively allows socket access. It owns at most
 * one {@link ProtosNioNetworkHost} and materializes it on the first {@code connectTcp} or {@code
 * listenTcp} acquisition, so a granted but unused Network creates no poller, selector, or socket.
 * The poller is a host-only Java thread: it never enters the Context or runs guest code, which is
 * why it does not depend on the Context's guest thread-creation permission. Acquisitions hand
 * their results to the existing acquisition flows, which deliver them to the owning Actor domain.
 *
 * <p>Closing is idempotent and is reached by Process termination and by Context finalization or
 * disposal. It closes the NIO host, which drains admitted control actions and releases every
 * channel registered with its poller (listeners, connections, and in-flight acquisitions); pending
 * acquisitions then fail and late resources are released by the acquisition flows. Activation
 * and closing share one monitor, so no poller starts after close. The NIO host is closed outside
 * that monitor because closing joins the poller thread.
