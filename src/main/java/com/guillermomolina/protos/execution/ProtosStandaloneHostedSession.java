/**
 * Supported reusable JVM embedding session: one live standalone Protos Process whose entry source
 * has been executed once and whose top-level Closures can then be invoked repeatedly.
 *
 * <p>Opening performs the same sequence as {@link ProtosStandaloneHostedExecution#executeFile}
 * (Core bootstrap, standalone Process bootstrap, Process-scoped Polyglot Context binding,
 * canonical direct-file execution) but keeps the Process, its Polyglot Context (and therefore
 * Engine and JIT/profiling state), and the runtime host alive until {@link #close()}. The
 * terminal outcome of that first execution is {@link #initialOutcome()}.
 *
 * <p>{@link #invokeTopLevel} reads the named slot of the entry module instance and invokes the
 * Closure it holds as a RootActor-local task in that same Process; no source text is parsed per
 * call. {@link #prepareTopLevel} instead resolves that slot once and retains the Closure for
 * repeated invocation.
 *
 * <p>Guest operations run on the thread that calls the session operation (PLAT046 Candidate B),
 * through the Process execution host and Polyglot Context entry; the session starts no guest
 * thread of its own. A session may be shared between threads: a session-local gate admits at most
 * one guest operation at a time. {@link #close()} makes its cutover visible first, so no operation
 * begins afterwards, then waits at the same gate for an already-started operation to finish before
 * tearing down.
